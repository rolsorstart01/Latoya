How to set it up on Vercel:
Push your code to GitHub (keep your structure as it is).

Import the project to Vercel.

The Secret Step: During the "Configure Project" screen, look for Root Directory.

Click "Edit" and select your pages folder.

This tells Vercel: "Everything the user needs to see is inside here."
